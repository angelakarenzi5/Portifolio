          <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
           <p>My name is <em>Angela Uwase Karenzi</em> and i'm 19years old, graduated in the year 2017 June and decided to take a year off after highschool. During my time at school,
           not only was I a satisfactory academic achiever but I was sought to expand my abilities past the four walls of my classroom. I am an Extremely organized, Creative,
           Humorous, a Quick learner,a Risk-taker,a Strong-verbal communicator in progress, and a Cooperative team member.These characteristics greatly added value to the business
           idea that I had after working at a training center as a tutor, my risk-taking self started the business this year,2018, in February. Consequently, I am generally a curious
           individual who is also hungry to learn and explore other fields. After taking Sciences and languages back in school, coding was never part of the picture until my bestfriend
           sent me a link (wecode) I decided to apply but didn't take the application as serious. A few days later, I was called and here I am, creating websites and feeding the hunger
           in me to learn.</p>

          <h3>HOBBIES</h3>
           <p>Growing up, I had several hobbies, I enjoyed playing tennis, swimming, badminton, basketball and traditional dance. I explored most of my hobbies during my holidays. However,
             now I don't have the time to entertain all of them, Which is why traditional dance beats them all and is still my hobbie. I was introduced to traditional dance at a very young age,
             ever since then, traditional dance stays winning. I mean the beauty of it is obviously the aftermath of sweating, twists and turns. But it comes from a patriotic heart, you can't
             be dancing for no reason, at least that's my mentality. It helps me physically work out on my body and releases stress. I workout whilst dancing. It's my all-time favorite hobbie.</p>

         <h2>List of Projects created</h1>
      <p>After pre-prep at Moringa School, I was priviledged to proceed to prep.
         Prep started a week ago and it's far different from pre-prep and that was a shock for me,
         the content was so much to cover in a day.We started with the terminal, installing atom, 
         opened up an account on GitHub. Below is a list of links of the projects that I created.</p>
        <div id="list">
        <ol>
          <li><a target ="_blank" href="https://github.com/angelakarenzi5/cookie-recipe.git">Cookie-recipe</a>
          <p><strong>Cookie-recipe was created by ellenklehman. She used the html language, however, she didn't correctly indent her work and
            I was given the task to make sure she has the right indentation.
            Once you double click the Cookie-recipe navigation, it will show you the edited version. 
            Incorrect indentation won't affect the functionality of the webpage, but it is easy to have the right indentation 
            in order to be able to read your codes and understand them. Quality is one of the things we stand for here at Moringa School, 
            therefore a well indented page is evidence that you are a good software developer.</strong></p>
           </li>
           <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/angelakarenzi5/Pet-webpage.git">Pet-webpage</a>
           <p><strong>Pet-webpage was created by html and the goal for this webpage was to polish ou html skills; 
            including the title, body, headers, lists using ul and ol, the main target was to highlight the difference between ul and ol;
            ul presenting lists in bullet points, whereas, ol presenting lists in the form of numbers, while writing out your code. It is important
            to know the difference in order to get a specific output of what you have in mind.</strong></p>
           </li>
           <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/angelakarenzi5/my-first-webpage.git">My-first-webpage</a>
           <p><strong>My-first-webpage was created in html but the aim of this project was to include the README document, It's often the first thing someone new to your project
              sees and is frequently the only source of documentation. It gives a list of information and every repository has a different README file.
              It's important to have an organized and detailed README because if people see an incomplete or messy  README, they will assume your code is like that.
              As well as having different files in one repository, I was taught the possibility and what it looks like on the repository I created on GitHub, for more information,
              double click on My-first-webpage.</strong></p>
           </li>
           <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/angelakarenzi5/first-website-new.git">First-website-new</a>
           <p><strong>Finally, for the First-website-new project, the lesson outcome was to style the html project. Everyone is interested in adding color, images to a blank page. We use the
              cascading style sheet to style our pages. We open the sheet right next the html page we are styling, in order to be able to style in the cascading stylesheet, you need to
              be able to link your page. For more information on how its done, double click "First-website-new" and observe the way it was linked in the html page.</strong></p>
